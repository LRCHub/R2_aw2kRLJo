I wander through this dream
Awake Alive
But something is wrong
These pastel skies, this soda stream
This pancake earth is gone
Just tell me
You feel
Exactly the same
Just tell me
You feel
No warmth in the flame
So tell me
That we
Have things we can mend
Just tell me
That we
Are not at the end
So tell me
Just tell me
Tell me
Tell me…
So tell me
As everything I know is changing
Try to find a way to stand my ground
Everything I know is rearranging
As I turn to look around
I am torn
This is me
But I see
I am free now
I am born
Once again
Cut the chain
Start a new reign
All that glitters cannot stay gold
Even raging fires will grow cold
I'll be strong
Unafraid
Be re-made
This is my ANGEL FADE
My wings are frail, they lose
Their powers
No way
For me to fly now
These cotton clouds,
these candy flowers
I know
They're all a lie
Just look at the skies
They're tearing apart
Do you realize
You're breaking my heart
So tell me
That we
Have things we can mend
Just tell me
That we
Are not at the end
So tell me
Just tell me
Tell me
Tell me…
So tell me
As everything I know is changing
Try to find a way to stand my ground
Everything I know is rearranging
As I turn to look around
I am torn
This is me
But I see
I am free now
I am born
Once again
Cut the chain
Start a new reign
All that glitters cannot stay gold
Even raging fires will grow cold
I'll be strong
Unafraid
Be re-made
This is my ANGEL FADE
There was a time my dream
Came true
My heart
Was young and care-free
I know that I was here
With you
For that
I feel so happy...
